# Customer Segmentation
### What is cohort analysis?

A cohort is simply a group of people with shared characteristics.

Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics in which you group your users based on their shared traits to better track and understand their actions. Cohort analysis allows you to ask more specific, targeted questions and make informed product decisions that will reduce churn and drastically increase revenue. You could also call it customer churn analysis.

To find out why your users stop using your app, you have to answer the three W's of user retention:

1. Who is engaging with your app—and who isn’t?
2. When do they churn?
3. Why do they lose interest?
You can only do this by segmenting your users into groups—or cohorts—based on a particular trait. The 2 most common cohort types are:

Acquisition cohorts: Groups divided based on when they signed up for your product
Behavioral cohorts: Groups divided based on their behaviors and actions in your product
Acquisition cohorts help you determine the who and the when, while behavioral cohorts enable you to dive into the why.

Retention hacking is the new growth hacking—it doesn't matter how many customers your startup acquires if none of them stick around.
## What is RFM Analysis?

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

Smart marketers understand the importance of “know thy customer.” Instead of simply focusing on generating more clicks, marketers must follow the paradigm shift from increased CTRs (Click-Through Rates) to retention, loyalty, and building customer relationships.
### RFM factors illustrate these facts:

1. The more recent the purchase, the more responsive the customer is to promotions
2. The more frequently the customer buys, the more engaged and satisfied they are
3. Monetary value differentiates heavy spenders from low-value purchasers
